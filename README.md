### About Rooms

These isn't any room after all, but

Talk: Where the talk will be kept.

Lab: Lab schedule

General: the rest.

Kitchen:

### Talk's event ids

on the web page the id are in the form of (looks like) YY[S|T]nn,
I have used the same code with the difference:

S -> 5
T -> 7

so the talk id 17S03 become 17503 and the talk id 17T05 becomes 17705.

### Lab room's event ids

day 1 - 1001, 1002, 1003 ...

day 2 - 2001, 2002, 2003 ...

...

### Kitchen events id

day 1 - 1101, 1102 ...

day 2 - 2101, 2102 ...

### Person ids

same id of the 1st talk the preson keep, but any other way is acceptable.
